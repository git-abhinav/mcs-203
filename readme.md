#### _By : (Abhinav, Ayush, Divesh, Vrinda_)






## Dataset


 Details of ambient air quality with respect to air quality parameters, like Sulfur dioxide, Nitrogen dioxide, Respirable Suspended Particulate Matter (RSPM) and Suspended Particulate Matter (SPM) etc. are given in the datasets.
## Source

## Vision


* To analyze the correlation  between pollutants and area.
* Performing various statistical techniques for visualizing patterns in the air quality index.
* Predicting the type of the area depending upon the AQI.


## Techniques


* Exploratory data analysis using visualization tools.
* Clustering
* Predictive modeling
