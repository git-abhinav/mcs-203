## Vision


* To analyze the correlation  between pollutants and area.
* Performing various statistical techniques for visualizing patterns in the air quality index.
* Predicting the type of the area depending upon the AQI.


## Techniques


* Exploratory data analysis using visualization tools.
* Clustering
* Predictive modeling
